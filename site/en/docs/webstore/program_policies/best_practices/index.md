<!--lint disable no-smart-quotes-->

- Extensions should add value to the Chrome Web Store. If your extension is not
  particularly useful or unique, it doesn’t belong on the Chrome Web Store.

- No cheating. If you attempt to scam the system (for example, by misleading
  users, circumventing enforcement, copying the work of other developers, or
  manipulating your extension’s reviews or ratings) you will be banned from the
  Chrome Web Store.

- Ensure that all of your extension’s information and metadata are up to date
  and accurate.

- Test your extensions for crashes, broken features, and bugs prior to
  submission.

- Verify that your contact information is correct to ensure you receive
  important communications for the Chrome Web Store.

- Include detailed information in the single purpose field regarding your
  extension’s primary functionality.

- Disclose any relevant third party associations in the extensions metadata

- If your extension requires an account to access its features, provide an
  active demo account with login information so that we can review your
  extension.

- Provide meaningful customer support for your extension.

  accounts when more than one is needed - group publishers]

- Versioning - use the most up to date version
